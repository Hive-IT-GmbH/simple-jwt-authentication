# simple-jwt-authentication

## Please note
Due to having had a lot of changes in my personal and work life I find myself with very little time to maintain this plugin. 
 I created this fork years ago because at the time the original author had abandoned his plugin and there wasn't any other options out there.
Today, that's not the case and I'm glad! I've learned that there's now also a proper plugin with active development up on wordpress.org.

For that reason I will recommend any newcomers here to instead use the plugin on wordpress.org found here:
https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-jwt-login/

**For everyone else, this plugin still works!**
If you have issues with it due to WordPress core updates or the likes I will try to get it fixed. 
I still gladly accept PRs too with improvements.
